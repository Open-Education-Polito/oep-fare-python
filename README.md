# FARE Python Online Drupal Module
This module is intended to be used together with FARE (set as dependency).

## How To
The module requires the `bundle.js` file to be correctly located in the `js`
folder. 
So, once cloned, in order for it to work you have to also checkout this other
repo:
[oep-python-online](https://github.com/Open-Education-Polito/oep-python-online)
and follow the instruction over there. Once the `bundle.js` file has been
correctly generated, copy that file inside the `js` folder of this module. 

## Licensing
This module has a GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.
